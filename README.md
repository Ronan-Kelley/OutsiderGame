# OutsiderGame
OutsiderGame is a poorly named project I wrote in my sophomore year of high school for my AP lang class's final project
and is loosely thematically based upon the book The Outsider by Steven King, specifically upon a scene towards the end
of the book that takes place in a cave. This game was written from scratch in java over the course of about 2 days and
is the first game I ever wrote in java.

All character sprites were created by Taylor Gilbert.

controls may only be input via gamepads, as this game was written to be played as a 1v1 fighting game between students
as a live demo as per the project rubric for the class (not that a videogame was required, to be clear - just that we
create an interactive project with which to discuss our book). The controls are as follows:

left joystick - move

A - jump

Y - heavy attack

X - light attack
